    - Join the Mountains Table with the Countries Table on the "country" field from Mountains Table and "Country_Name" from Countries Table.
  - **Step 2: Partition by continent**  
    - Partition the joined data by the "Continent_Name" column from the Countries Table and order by "meters" in descending order.
  - **Step 3: Select top ten**  
    - For each continent partition, select the top ten rows to return the mountain details.

### 3. Most Northern Five Mountains per Country
- **Description:** Shows details for the five most northern mountains for each country.

| 3 | meters   | INT       | Directly carried from Mountains Table. |
| 4 | feet     | INT       | Directly carried from Mountains Table. |
| 5 | latitude | DECIMAL   | Directly carried from Mountains Table. |
| 6 | longitude| DECIMAL   | Directly carried from Mountains Table. |

- **Transformation Steps:**
  - **Step 1: Partition by country**  
    - Partition the Mountains Table data by the "country" column and order by "latitude" in descending order (to capture the most northern locations).
  - **Step 2: Select top five**  
    - For each country partition, retrieve the top five rows based on the highest latitude values.

### 4. Most Northern Five Mountains per Continent
- **Description:** Shows details for the five most northern mountains for each continent.
- **Depends On:**

| 5 | latitude | DECIMAL   | Directly carried from Mountains Table. |
| 6 | longitude| DECIMAL   | Directly carried from Mountains Table. |

- **Transformation Steps:**

- **Transformation Steps:**
  - **Step 1: Filter by height**  
    - Filter the Mountains Table to include only mountain records where the "meters" value is greater than 6000.
  - **Step 2: Calculate distance**  
    - For each remaining mountain record, calculate the distance from the mountain to Ojos del Salado using the latitude and longitude coordinates.
  - **Step 3: Filter by distance**  
    - Retain only those records where the calculated distance is within 200 kilometers of Ojos del Salado.
  - **Step 4: Retrieve mountain details**  
    - Return the full mountain details from those filtered records.
