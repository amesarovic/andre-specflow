# Introduction
This document supports enhanced analytics on some of the worldâ€™s highest mountains with a particular focus on the Andes range in South America. It provides detailed transformation steps and target table specifications to extract mountain details, filtered and sorted by various criteria, to fully inform exploration and understanding of the lay of the land.
